# cpp_to_do_tracker

# Overview

I wanted to accomplish learning some new C++ by building a console app that allows you to create a to-do list which holds data including task names, description, start dates, end dates, and whether the task is completed or not.

This software helps you to stay on task and have your "to-do items" written down with dates to hold you accountable. It's satisfying to look at your list and see it marked as completed.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio 2022 Console App creator. I programmed in C++ and used built in libraries including iostream, string, and limits.

# Future Work

- Clean up the way it looks in the console. Add more break points and spacers.
- Add more features like sub tasks.
- Figure out how to make dates add as dates and not as a string.
